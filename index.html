        <h3>Project: UnRestricted</h3>
        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
            Unrestricted is the food app for people with dietary restrictions. 
            The target audience is ideally those individuals who need to or would like to ensure that a certain food is excluded from their dish, 
            but it is open to everyone who would like to use it regardless! 
            The way the app would be used is when deciding on where to eat out. 
            The task of determining which restaurants are friendly to certain dietary restrictions can be daunting, 
            and this app should ease the pain. Users can log in to the app and have options of restaurants or dishes to try. 
            Users will be able to see other users’ reviews of restaurants or dishes, 
            and what the reviewer’s restrictions are so that they feel more confident. 
            For example, user A with celiacs disease might see a different user B’s review and decide on a restaurant based on the fact that user B is also celiac and did not have a negative experience at that particular restaurant.
            The user will be able to see the restaurant’s website as well as location in relation to their own coordinates.
